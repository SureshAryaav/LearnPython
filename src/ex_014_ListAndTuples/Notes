1️⃣ What is a List?
Mutable (you can change the contents)
Ordered
Can store elements of different types
Defined with []

2️⃣ What is a Tuple?
Immutable (cannot change contents after creation)
Ordered
Can store mixed data types
Defined with () instead of []

| Feature     | List                  | Tuple                          |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Mutability  | ✅ Mutable             | ❌ Immutable                    |
| Syntax      | `[]`                  | `()`                           |
| Methods     | Many built-in methods | Fewer built-in methods         |
| Performance | Slower                | Faster (more memory-efficient) |
| Use Case    | Use when data changes | Use when data is fixed         |

4️⃣ When to Use Which?
✅ List: When data is dynamic or frequently updated (e.g., shopping cart, user list)
✅ Tuple: When data is constant (e.g., days of the week, coordinates)
